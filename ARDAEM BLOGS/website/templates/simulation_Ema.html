  Philosopher Nick Bostrom, of the University of Oxford, proposed in the Philosophical Quarterly that the universe and everything in it might just be a simulation. Since then
  there has been intense public speculation and debate about the nature of reality which has intrigued scientists for centuries. Do we live in a simulation? Are we part of
  some kind of game being played by intelligent beings from another planet? But what if this is the case? What would it mean to know that you aren't here, but somewhere else instead? And why do we study such things at all?
  Is all this speculation worth the effort?
  
  <br>Public intellectuals like Elon Musk opined about the 
  statistical inevitability of our world being nothing but a bunch of cascading green code. Physicist Frank Wilczek argued that there’s too much wasted complexity 
  in our universe for it to be simulated. Building complexity requires time and energy. Why would a conscious, intelligent designer of realities waste so 
  many resources on making our world more complex than it entails? Yet another physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, argued that the question isn't scientific 
  anyway. Since the simulation hypothesis does not arrive at a falsifiable prediction, there isn't any way for us to actually test and either approve or 
  disprove it, and hence it’s not worth seriously investigating. Comedian Chuck Nice managed to give an astrophysicist goose bumps when discussing the laws 
  of physics in an episode of a podcast named StarTalk.The show’s host Neil deGrasse Tyson explained the idea that we could all
  be virtual beings living in a computer simulation. If so, the simulation would most likely create perceptions of reality on demand rather than simulate 
  all of reality every second just like a video game optimized to render only the parts of a scene visible to a player. “Maybe that’s why we can’t travel 
  faster than the speed of light, because if we could, we’d be able to get to another galaxy,” said Nice, the show’s co-host. “Before they can program it,” 
  the astrophysicist prompted. “So the programmer put in that limit.”
  <br>For all we know, this is what Shakespeare meant by 
  <br>"All the world's a stage, 
  <br>And all the men and women merely players."
