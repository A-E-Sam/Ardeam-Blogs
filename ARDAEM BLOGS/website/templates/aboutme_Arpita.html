"Who reads<br>
Incessantly, and to his reading brings not<br>
A spirit and judgment equal or superior<br>
Uncertain and unsettled still remains,<br>
Deep versed in books, and shallow in himself."<br>
<br>
"Mankind, instead of being the central figure on the stage of reality,
the rational creature for whom the non-rational world exists, is actually an accident, 
a late and adventitious newcomer whose life is governed by contingency; 
and the proof, paradoxically, comes from rationalism itself, from the Darwinian idea of evolution.
 Whatever may be the case with trees and stones and stars, man the thinker is a by-product, a nonessential component of reality, and he and all his works cling to existence with a hold that is tenuous and feeble."
â€” Nausea, Jean-Paul Sartre.

"My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence."  
- Sherlock Holmes, A.C. Doyle.

"So please, oh please, we beg, we pray,
Go throw your TV set away,
And in its place you can install
A lovely bookshelf on the wall."
