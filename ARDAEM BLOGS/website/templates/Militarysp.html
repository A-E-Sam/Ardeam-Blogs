But we must follow the footsteps of our own great military leaders of the past, who helped us to turn the tide when morale was suffering, casualties were high, and ammunition was low. When our fathers stood against the enemy countries, they had no such resources as we have now. We must live up to the standards they set. We must resist our enemies in any and every way, and try to leave out those who come after our human galaxy that is as great as ever.
<br>I’m amongst you all, in the midst and heat of the rebellious battle, to live or die amongst you all, to lay down for my kind, my honour and my blood.
<br><br>You will, by the dignity of your conduct, afford an occasion for posterity and say, ‘the world wouldn’t have seen a better display of perfection humanity is capable of, than the day eight humans outsmarted the aliens.’
<br><br>Shall we allow the audacious aliens to violate, with impunity, the territory of our foster stellar system? Will you allow these extraterrestrial beings to carry terror into your families?
<br>You will not, March then, to meet them, and tear from their brows their questions and clues. The result of our efforts will be unclouded glory and durable peace within Mu Normae and the future of our Type two genus.
